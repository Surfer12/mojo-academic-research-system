# About `__init__.py` in the `scripts` Directory

## Purpose

The `__init__.py` file is used to mark a directory as a Python package. This allows you to import modules from this directory using Python's package/module import system.

## Why is it needed?

- **Package Recognition:** Without `__init__.py`, Python does not recognize the directory as a package, and you cannot use `import` or `from ... import ...` statements referencing it as a package.
- **Relative Imports:** It enables relative imports between modules in the package, which is important for larger projects with multiple modules and sub-packages.
- **Project Structure:** It helps maintain a clean and modular project structure, making it easier to manage and scale your codebase.

## Example in This Project

Suppose you have the following structure:

```
meta-optimization-framework/
├── scripts/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── run_evaluation.py
```

With `__init__.py` present, you can run:

```bash
python -m scripts.run_evaluation
```

and Python will treat `scripts` as a package, allowing for proper imports and execution.

## What should be in `__init__.py`?

- It can be empty, or you can use it to initialize package-level variables or imports.
- For most cases, especially just to mark a directory as a package, an empty file is sufficient.

---

**In summary:**
- Always add `__init__.py` to directories you want Python to treat as packages.
- This is especially important for running modules with `-m` and for using relative imports.
