# Recursive Patterns in Mind-Wandering

## Abstract
This short example paper illustrates the style of research associated with Ryan Oates. We examine how mind-wandering exhibits fractal dynamics across multiple time scales using fMRI and behavioral reports.

## Methods
- Participants: 20 adults aged 18-35
- Procedure: resting-state fMRI with intermittent thought probes
- Analysis: fractal dimension calculations and recurrence quantification of default mode network activity

## Results
We observed scale-invariant fluctuations in attention with significant correlations between fractal dimension and subjective ratings of meta-awareness.

## Conclusions
The findings support a recursive model of attention-recognition decoupling wherein meta-awareness emerges from self-similar neural dynamics.
