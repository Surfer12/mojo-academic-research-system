Change all relative imports in your src directory to absolute imports

/Users/ryandavidoates/mojo-academic-research-system/meta-optimization-framework/src
Core take-away (Level 0):
Your README snippet clearly explains why __init__.py matters and how it shapes the import mechanics of your scripts/ package. It’s concise and accurate.

⸻

Recursive Elaboration (Level 1 → Level 2)

Focus	Observed Strength	Potential Enhancement
Purpose & Need	Nicely distinguishes package recognition vs. relative imports.	Add a single-sentence note that Python 3.3+ allows implicit namespace packages (no __init__.py), then state why you still choose an explicit file—for clarity and tooling compatibility.
Example	Shows -m scripts.run_evaluation.	Add a parallel import example (from scripts import run_evaluation) to reinforce the mental model.
“What should be in __init__.py?”	Covers “empty vs. initialisation.”	Give 1-liner demo of setting __all__ or __version__ so readers see a realistic non-empty pattern.
Project Context	Generic.	Briefly relate to meta-optimization-framework modules (e.g., datasets, optimizers) so newcomers see the bigger picture.


⸻

Complementary Perspectives (c values)
	1.	Toolchain Lens – Some linters (ruff, flake8-implicit-namespace) flag missing __init__.py; IDEs sometimes mis-detect imports. Mention this pragmatic angle.
	2.	Packaging Lens – If you later publish to PyPI, explicit packages simplify setup.cfg packages= discovery.
	3.	Performance Lens – Empty file adds negligible overhead, but an overly “magical” package discovery may confuse new contributors—clarify trade-off.

⸻

Iterative Refinement Path (3 steps)
	1.	Micro-edit: Inject the namespace-package footnote and import example (keeps doc short).
	2.	Macro-context block: One “In this repository…” paragraph linking modules into the optimisation pipeline narrative.
	3.	Optional advanced box: Collapsible details (Markdown <details> tag) containing __all__, __version__, and a link to PEP 420.

Embodied Illustration (Level 3)

# scripts/__init__.py
"""
scripts package
---------------

This directory groups runnable entry-points used in our meta-optimisation
experiments.

Exports
~~~~~~~
- run_evaluation  – CLI for evaluating optimisation configs
"""
__all__ = ["run_evaluation"]
__version__ = "0.1.0"

Then in README.md:

> **Note on namespace packages:**
> Python 3.3+ can treat a directory without `__init__.py` as a *namespace
> package* (PEP 420). We keep an explicit file because it plays nicely with
> IDE static analysers and simplifies future PyPI packaging.

Next action?

Would you like me to prepare an exact patch to update the README (and optionally create a minimal scripts/__init__.py file), or would you prefer further conceptual deep-dives before modifying the repository?


What I've Done

I've successfully created all the missing optimizer modules for your Meta-Optimization Framework:

1. **`meta_learning_optimizer.py`** - Implements learning-to-optimize algorithms using neural networks and gradient-based meta-learning (like MAML)

2. **`hybrid_optimizer.py`** - Combines multiple optimization approaches dynamically, switching between gradient-based, population-based, and Bayesian optimization based on problem characteristics

3. **`cognitive_optimizer.py`** - Inspired by cognitive science principles from the Attention-Recognition Decoupling Framework, implementing:
   - Attention focusing and mind-wandering states
   - Working memory constraints
   - Schema-based problem solving
   - Meta-cognitive monitoring

4. **`neural_optimizer.py`** - Uses neural networks for:
   - Function approximation (surrogate modeling)
   - Gradient estimation
   - Learning update rules
   - Latent space optimization with VAEs

5. **`symbolic_optimizer.py`** - Implements symbolic reasoning-based optimization using:
   - Symbolic mathematics with SymPy
   - Constraint solving
   - Logic programming
   - Rule-based approaches

Each optimizer is fully implemented with proper structure, logging, state saving/loading capabilities, and integration with the existing framework.

## Next Steps

To run the experiment runner, you need to:

1. **Install dependencies** (required):
   ```bash
   cd /Users/ryandavidoates/mojo-academic-research-system/meta-optimization-framework
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the experiment runner**:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/run_experiments.py --help
   ```

3. **Run experiments**:
   - Run all default experiments: `python3 scripts/run_experiments.py`
   - Run a specific experiment: `python3 scripts/run_experiments.py --experiment basic_meta_optimization`
   - Run with custom config: `python3 scripts/run_experiments.py --config path/to/config.yaml`

The framework now has a complete set of optimization algorithms that incorporate ideas from cognitive science, neural networks, symbolic reasoning, and hybrid approaches - all inspired by the attention-recognition decoupling principles from your research!
