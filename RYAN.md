What I've Done

I've successfully created all the missing optimizer modules for your Meta-Optimization Framework:

1. **`meta_learning_optimizer.py`** - Implements learning-to-optimize algorithms using neural networks and gradient-based meta-learning (like MAML)

2. **`hybrid_optimizer.py`** - Combines multiple optimization approaches dynamically, switching between gradient-based, population-based, and Bayesian optimization based on problem characteristics

3. **`cognitive_optimizer.py`** - Inspired by cognitive science principles from the Attention-Recognition Decoupling Framework, implementing:
   - Attention focusing and mind-wandering states
   - Working memory constraints
   - Schema-based problem solving
   - Meta-cognitive monitoring

4. **`neural_optimizer.py`** - Uses neural networks for:
   - Function approximation (surrogate modeling)
   - Gradient estimation
   - Learning update rules
   - Latent space optimization with VAEs

5. **`symbolic_optimizer.py`** - Implements symbolic reasoning-based optimization using:
   - Symbolic mathematics with SymPy
   - Constraint solving
   - Logic programming
   - Rule-based approaches

Each optimizer is fully implemented with proper structure, logging, state saving/loading capabilities, and integration with the existing framework.

## Next Steps

To run the experiment runner, you need to:

1. **Install dependencies** (required):
   ```bash
   cd /Users/ryandavidoates/mojo-academic-research-system/meta-optimization-framework
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the experiment runner**:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/run_experiments.py --help
   ```

3. **Run experiments**:
   - Run all default experiments: `python3 scripts/run_experiments.py`
   - Run a specific experiment: `python3 scripts/run_experiments.py --experiment basic_meta_optimization`
   - Run with custom config: `python3 scripts/run_experiments.py --config path/to/config.yaml`

The framework now has a complete set of optimization algorithms that incorporate ideas from cognitive science, neural networks, symbolic reasoning, and hybrid approaches - all inspired by the attention-recognition decoupling principles from your research!
